# Introduction to Data Engineering

# Presentation Deck Template

## Usage

Edit and extend your slides inside the `src/slides.md` file. Navigate with the arrow keys.

```bash
# To develop & write
$ yarn develop

# To build
$ yarn build
```

## Writing

By default, use [src/slides/](src/slides/).

Markdown files are loaded in sorted path order. Slides are generated by
splitting each markdown file along `<hr/>` elements (`---` in Markdown lingo).

Examples:

```md
# This is the first slide

---

## This is the second slide
