# Streaming data
* Some systems require R/T or near R/T processing of new data
* Meaning a stream of data is continuously processed
* In that case, you should consider a Messaging Pub-Sub system that is designed to handle your volumes of data
* These would allow (multiple) consumers to subscribe to new data, view it and/or process it
