# Sounds perfect, but it is not that simple

* Let us discuss the following characteristics about a distributed system:
    - **C**onsistency: All nodes have the exact same data at the exact same time
    - **A**vailability: Every request to a node receives a response (success or failure)
    - **P**artition tolerance: The system does not suffer by the system being partitioned (i.e. messaging between nodes, data being partitioned to multiple nodes)
